# Sobel-Operator
Using Intelâ€™s Quartus toolchain and a DE10 board, I implemented a Sobel Operator mask for edge detection that took an RGB image, stored the grayscale in synthesized RAM, 
then processed that grayscale to another instance of RAM to provide both the horizontal and vertical components of the Sobel Operator.
